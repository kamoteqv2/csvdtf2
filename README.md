# csvdtf2
 
Description:

The csvdtf2.exe is a utility app that processes any CSV file with a "timestamp" column and converts it into a formatted date-time column. The app then exports the processed data into a new CSV file.

How to use:

Download the csvdtformatter.exe file.
Open Command Prompt or Terminal.
Navigate to the directory where the csvdtformatter.exe is located.
Type in "csvdtf2.exe [filename].csv" and press enter.
The app will process the data and export a new file named "processed_[filename].csv" in the same directory.
Note: The input CSV file should have a column named "timestamp" for the app to work correctly.
